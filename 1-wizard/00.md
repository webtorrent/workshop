# 00 - Include WebTorrent in a page

WebTorrent is the first torrent client that works in the browser. In this workshop you will learn how to download a torrent and view it in the browser.

Start by including the WebTorrent library in a webpage.

## Tips

We recommend using [CodePen](https://codepen.io/pen/) to work through the workshop (to save time setting up a local environment).

To start using WebTorrent, simply include the
[`webtorrent.min.js`](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/webtorrent@latest/webtorrent.min.js)
script on your page.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/webtorrent@latest/webtorrent.min.js"></script>
```

This provides a `WebTorrent` function on the global `window` object.

Log out the version of WebTorrent currently in use.

```js
console.log(WebTorrent.VERSION)
```

## Verify

Open the browser console and confirm that you see the output we printed. If it worked correctly, you should see the following output (or something similar):

```
0.108.5
```

Note: If there are other warning or errors generated by the CodePen site, you can probably ignore those.

Congrats, you've made the first step to downloading a torrent in the browser.
