# 05 - Render everything in the torrent

Write a script that downloads the torrent [The WIRED CD](https://webtorrent.io/torrents/wired-cd.torrent) and displays all the files in the torrent, regardless of their file type. In addition to `.mp3` files, this torrent also contains an album art image (a `.jpg` file) and a readme file (a `.md` file).

Let's display all the files in the page, not just the `.mp3` files!

## Tips

Instead of selecting the `.mp3` files, just loop over all the files in `torrent.files` and display them all. Rather than give you the code for this one, we're going to let you figure it out! If you get stuck, feel free to ask for help.

## Verify

If it worked, you should see an `<audio>` tag added to the page for each track in The WIRED CD. You should also see an image and a text file included, as well.

WebTorrent can even handle rendering images, `.pdf` files, `.html` files, `.txt` files, and more. (If you're curious, this magic is implemented in the [`render-media`](https://github.com/feross/render-media) package on npm.)
